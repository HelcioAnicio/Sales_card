## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML 
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Responsiveness
- Pseudo-classes

### What I learned

This project was my first time that i use a pseudo-element:

```CSS
button:hover {
    background-color: hsl(159, 59%, 16%);
}
```

### Continued development

In the next projects i'll dedicate my efforts to learn and practice more properties in CSS and HTML, like more pseudo-elements and media query and make my site more accessible.

### Useful resources

This resource helped me a lot to understand how to do what I wanted.
